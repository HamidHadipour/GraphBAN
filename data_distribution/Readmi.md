This filder includes the code to generate features for compound and proteins in datasets and plot the t-SNE plots to show the distribution of interactions.
The code used to generate Supplementary Figure 1. The exact data used to provide current t-SNE plots are provided in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14862104).
